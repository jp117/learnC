# learnC

## Structure

This repo is organized to reflect how I'm learning C through both tutorials and hands-on practice:

### `tutorials/`
Contains my solutions to the exercises from [LearnC.org](https://www.learn-c.org/), organized by topic (Basics, Advanced, etc.). Each file is named by topic and compiled to the local `build/` folder (ignored by Git).

### `lessons/`
Contains Markdown reflections comparing my implementations to official or reference solutions — when I passed the tests but used a different or less idiomatic approach. These documents help track how I grow from functional to production-ready code.

### `challenge/`
Contains problem-solving challenges generated by ChatGPT. These are focused on applying core C concepts — pointers, arrays, linked lists, etc. — to reinforce understanding through practical tasks. Compiled objects go into a local `build/` folder (also Git-ignored).

### `.gitignore`
Ensures that `build/` folders inside both `challenge/` and `tutorials/` are excluded from version control.

## Philosophy

I’m learning C with two goals:
1. **Understand how memory works under the hood** — from pointers to allocation.
2. **Develop strong low-level programming habits** to complement my experience in higher-level languages.

This repo helps me track progress, reflect on design trade-offs, and grow through test-driven, hands-on learning.
